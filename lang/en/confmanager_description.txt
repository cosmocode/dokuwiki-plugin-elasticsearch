Elasticsearch can index media files by using external tools/parsers to extract the text content of the files. The parsers can be command line tools or web services. They must return plain text or a JSON structure. Define parsers for each file extension that should be processed. Use ''%in%'' to specify the input file for CLI tools. Web services must accept the input file as POST data. Here's a short example: <code> pdf /usr/bin/pdftotext %in% - docx http://givemetext.okfnlabs.org/tika/rmeta </code>
